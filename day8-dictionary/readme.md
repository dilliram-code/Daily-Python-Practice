- A dictionary in Python is a `built-in` data type that stores data in key-value pairs.
- It is unordered (before Python 3.7), but since Python 3.7+, dictionaries maintain insertion order.

**Keys to Note down**
- ✅ Keys are unique and must be immutable types (string, number, tuple).
- ✅ Values can be of any type (list, int, dict, etc.).



## 📌 Dictionary vs List – When to Use?

### ✅ Use **Dictionary (`dict`)** when:
- You need **fast lookup** by a **unique key**.  
- Data is best represented as **key-value pairs**.  
- Example: Storing student IDs with their names.

### ✅ Use **List (`list`)** when:
- You care about **ordering** of items.  
- You don’t need **key-based access**.  
- Example: Maintaining a sequence of tasks.
