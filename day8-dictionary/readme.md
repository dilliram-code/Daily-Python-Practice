- A dictionary in Python is a `built-in` data type that stores data in key-value pairs.
- It is unordered (before Python 3.7), but since Python 3.7+, dictionaries maintain insertion order.

**Keys to Note down**
- ✅ Keys are unique and must be immutable types (string, number, tuple).
- ✅ Values can be of any type (list, int, dict, etc.).
