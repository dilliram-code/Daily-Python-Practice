    "### üêç What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a `high-level`, `general-purpose`, `interpreted` programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It is known for its `simplicity`, `readability`, and `versatility`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üí° Why Do We Need Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "We need Python because it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Saves development time` ‚Äî You can write fewer lines of code compared to C, C++, or Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Supports multiple programming paradigms` ‚Äî such as Object-Oriented, Procedural, and Functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Has huge community support` ‚Äî millions of developers, open-source libraries, and frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Is platform-independent` ‚Äî it runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and even on mobile and embedded systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Integrates` easily with other languages like C, C++, Java, and databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Is widely used across industries` ‚Äî from web apps and automation to AI, machine learning, and data science.\n",
