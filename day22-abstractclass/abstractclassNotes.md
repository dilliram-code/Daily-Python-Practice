**What is an Abstract Class?**

- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. - It serves as a blueprint for other classes.

- Abstract classes can contain abstract methods (methods without implementation) and concrete methods (regular methods with implementation).

- They are useful when you want derived classes to implement specific methods while sharing some common functionality.
