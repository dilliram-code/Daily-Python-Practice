**What is Inheritance (and why use it)?**

- Inheritance lets a class (the child/subclass) reuse and extend behavior/data from another class (the parent/base/superclass).

- Reuse: avoid rewriting shared code.

- Specialize: override or add new behavior in children.

- Polymorphism: different subclasses can be used through a common interface.
