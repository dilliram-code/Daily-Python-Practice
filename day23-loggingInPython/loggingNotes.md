**1. What is Logging in Python?**

Logging is a way to record messages from your program while it runs.
`It helps in:`

- Debugging your code.
- Tracking events.
- Recording errors/warnings.
- Keeping history of program execution.
- Instead of using `print()`, Pythonâ€™s logging module is more powerful, flexible, and professional.
